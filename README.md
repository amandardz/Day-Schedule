## Usage
To begin, as a developer, think about how the user will interact with the calendar to help break down steps to write and utilize HTML, CSS, and JQuery necessary for it to perform its function. Below are the steps of how user will interact with the calendar:
1.  When user opens the schedule, they will see current day displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. As user scrolls down the calendar, they will see time-blocks for each hour in a work day. The time-blocks will be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future(green)
3. The user will enter an event in the time-block and click the save button to save that event. 
4. When the user refreshes the page, the event saved will persist in the time-block.
